# Scripts
## Deploying the Application

### Build and Deploy

To build and deploy the frontend and infrastructure:

1. Open a terminal in the `infra` directory.
2. Run:

	```bash
	npm run deploy
	```

This will build the frontend, upload it to S3, and invalidate the CloudFront cache automatically.

You can also use:

- `npm run build` – Build the frontend and infrastructure code only
- `npm run synth` – Synthesize the CloudFormation template
- `npm run destroy` – Remove the deployed stack from AWS
